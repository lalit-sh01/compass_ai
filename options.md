AI-Native Design Concept: The "Focus" Interface
1. Problem Analysis
The current "document-style" or even "dashboard-style" layouts are passive. They present information and wait for the user to decide what to do.

Lack of Direction: "What should I do right now?" is not answered.
Cognitive Load: The user has to scan Build, Research, and Share to find their place.
Wasted Space: Static cards take up room even when they aren't relevant (e.g., showing "Share" details when "Build" isn't started).
Missed AI Potential: The app knows the roadmap but isn't acting as a guide.
2. The "AI-Native" Philosophy
An AI-native interface should be proactive, context-aware, and adaptive.

Proactive: It suggests the next step.
Context-Aware: It changes based on what you've done.
Adaptive: It hides irrelevant complexity.
3. Proposed Concept: "The Active Focus"
A. The "Next Action" Hero Section
Instead of a static header, the top of the page is a dynamic "Hero" card that highlights the single most important task right now.

Example: If I haven't started, it shows "Start Build: Step 1".
Example: If I checked off 3 deliverables, it shows "Resume: Deliverable #4".
Visuals: High contrast, large typography, direct "Start/Resume" action button.
B. The "Smart Stream" Layout (Replacing Static Columns)
Instead of fixed columns, use a fluid stream that prioritizes content.

Focus Zone (Top): The Hero Card + AI Context (e.g., "Why this matters: This build teaches you the basics of LLMs...").
Active Context (Middle): The section currently in progress (e.g., the full Build card). Other sections (Research, Share) are collapsed or minimized until needed.
AI Copilot (Sidebar/Floating): A persistent chat/insight interface.
"I'm stuck on Step 3" -> AI provides specific debugging tips for that step.
"Explain this concept" -> AI explains the tech stack item.
C. "Living" White Space
Remove "dead" white space. Use space for:

Micro-Learning: Small, AI-generated tips relevant to the current task.
Progress Pulse: subtle visual indicators of momentum (e.g., "You're on a streak!").

5. Key AI Features to Add
Dynamic Reordering: If "Research" is a blocker for "Build", move it up.
Smart Summaries: "You spent 4h on Build. AI suggests moving to Research to avoid burnout."
Contextual Help: When hovering over a deliverable, show a "How to" button generated by AI.
6. Recommendation
Move away from the static "Week View" and build a "Current Focus" view. The "Week" is just the container; the experience is the flow of tasks.
